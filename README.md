In various domains, many datasets exhibit both high variable dependency and group structures, which necessitates their simultaneous estimation. In this R package, we provide functions related to two subgroup identification methods based on penalized functions. These two methods, utilizing factor model structures, are adaptable to data with crosssectional dependency. The first is the Center Augmented Factor Adjusted Regression Model (CAFARM) we proposed. Utilizing center-augmented penalty functions and factor structures, CAFARM eliminates data dependencies while identifying subgroups within datasets. We provide CAFARM methods optimized using Coordinate Descent and the Difference of ConvexAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers (DC-ADMM), applicable for both L1 and L2 distance cases. The other model is the Factor-Adjusted Pairwise Fusion Penalty (FA-PFP) approach, which integrates factor augmentation into the pairwise fusion penalty framework by Ma and Huang (2017). We also provide a function for the Standard CAR (SCAR) method in this package, which does not consider the dependency and is for comparative analysis with our approaches. Furthermore, functions based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are also included for selecting tuning parameters in CAFARM and FA-PFP.
